   <u><h2 align="Center">Section-1.&nbsp; My Favourite Hobbies</h2></u>
   <p> <em>Reading books is my hobby. This hobby got started when I was a little boy. It is one of the
         best habits that one can cultivate. Books provide the reader with so much information and facts. Book is the
         best medicine to eradicate boredom. They provide relief from monotony. I can enjoy the company of great writers
         by reading their works.
         One of my favorite pastimes is playing cricket. The thrill of batting, the challenge of bowling, and the
         camaraderie with teammates make it immensely enjoyable. Every weekend, I eagerly gather with friends at the
         local field, where we play for hours, lost in the excitement of the game.</em></p>
